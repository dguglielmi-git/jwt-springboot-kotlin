# Kotlin Backend with JSON Web Token

This is a basic template for JSON Web Token Project. It manages User and Roles.

## Getting Started üöÄ

In order to start using this project, after downloading or have it cloned from the repository, you should configure the database access.
In this project, we are using a MySQL DataBase, but in case you need to use another one, you should provide all these configuration into the DataSource.

* [Connecting utilizing DataSourceConfig Bean](#)

You can start modifying the DataSourceConfig located into configuration folder within the Project, and change all the information regarding DB access. 

* [Connecting utilizing application.properties](#)

Go to JwtSpringbootKotlinApplication.kt and modify it removing the line related to DataSourceAutoConfiguration:class

* Example as you will find it:
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = [SecurityAutoConfiguration::class, DataSourceAutoConfiguration::class])


* After removing it:
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = [SecurityAutoConfiguration::class])

Then you can comment or delete the DataSourceConfig, and modify application.properties file by adding the following lines:
```#spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/labs
# Example of configuration utilizing MySQL
spring.datasource.username=labs
spring.datasource.password=labspassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

### Pre-requisites üìã

To use this example you must have installed a MySQL Engine, or at least, connection data to a MySQL Database. Otherwise, you must adapt this project to connect it to another engine you may like.
